# Zoom-Best-Practices
This repository contains some thoughts about best practices for remote instruction.

# Thoughts on my experience, which may differ.

* Use a quiet location with as little external sound as possible.  
* Distribute materials through NYU Classes.
* Display materials through "Share Your Desktop" feature in Zoom.
* I pause to ask if there are questions or thoughts on a frequent basis.
* Use a wired microphone rather than bluetooth.  
* I will record a brief example using the DiPasquale-Wheaton model on a PPT.  (Cosmic justice.)
